# Gas Discrete Helper

A comprehensive Clarity smart contract library for gas optimization and discrete function utilities, designed to help developers write more efficient and cost-effective smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Smart Contract Infrastructure

The library consists of four core smart contracts that provide advanced gas optimization techniques and discrete computational helpers:

### Gas Optimizer Contract
A utility contract that offers techniques and functions to minimize gas consumption in Clarity smart contracts:
- Gas consumption analysis
- Efficient data storage strategies
- Computational optimization patterns
- Gas-aware design recommendations

### Discrete Calculator Contract
Implements precise mathematical and computational functions with minimal gas overhead:
- Discrete mathematical operations
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- Algorithmic efficiency techniques
- Computational complexity reduction

### Transaction Helper Contract
Provides utility functions for transaction management and gas-efficient processing:
- Transaction cost estimation
- Batch processing utilities
- Efficient state management
- Minimal overhead transaction helpers

### Gas Tracker Contract
Tracks and analyzes gas consumption across different contract functions:
- Runtime gas measurement
- Function-level gas profiling
- Optimization recommendations
- Historical gas consumption analysis
